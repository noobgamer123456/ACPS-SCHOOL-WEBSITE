        A day on Venus lasts longer than a year on Venus. Saturn could float in
        water because it is mostly gas. Footprints left on the Moon will remain
        for millions of years due to the lack of wind. The Sun is so massive
        that over 1 million Earths could fit inside it. Jupiter has a storm
        called the Great Red Spot that has been raging for hundreds of years.
        Astronauts grow taller in space because their spines expand without
        Earthâ€™s gravity compressing them.

      <p>
        Some planets and moons have extreme conditions that seem unbelievable.
        For instance, temperatures on Mercury can reach 430Â°C during the day and
        drop to âˆ’180Â°C at night, showing the extreme variety of environments in
        our solar system.

      <p>
        The universe is full of surprises. For example, neutron stars are so
        dense that a single teaspoon of their matter would weigh billions of
        tons on Earth.

      <p>
        Even ordinary phenomena can be amazing in space. Shooting stars, or
        meteoroids burning up in Earth's atmosphere, are simple yet spectacular
        examples of our universe in action.
